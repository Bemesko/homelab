# My Homelab

This repository has the configuration files for my homelab environment. It is currently a work-in-progress.

## To-dos:

- [X] Finish setting up resources in AWS
- [ ] Set up GitHub workflows
  - [ ] terraform apply
  - [ ] terraform destroy (run every hour or so to reduce risk of being charged)
